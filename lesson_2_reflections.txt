What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a directory called .git, when we intialize the repository. We need to do it to make it trackable via git.

Staging area contains a file which is added to be committed. It shows the added file as a new file under the section "changes to be committed".

check git diff --staged

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

adding one file and commiting with a message and then add another file and commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If we are making some experimental version of our code, then we can create a new branch. So now we can have 2 different versions, keeping old one intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

By diagram we can traverse back to initial commit and can know which commits are experimental and all branches. 

currently on master and making a new commit, then merge and see the result

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

we can see all commits made in two branches. And we can get a fully working version in one branch. Diagram is useful to know that which commits are going to be in final merge.

master
